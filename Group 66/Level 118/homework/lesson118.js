// HTTP stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol

// WWW is about communication between web clients and servers

// Communication between client computers and web servers is done by sending HTTP Requests and receiving HTTP Responses


// Communication between clients and servers is done by requests and responses:

// A client (a browser) sends an HTTP request to the web
// A web server receives the request
// The server runs an application to process the request
// The server returns an HTTP response (output) to the browser
// The client (the browser) receives the response



// A typical HTTP request / response circle:

// The browser requests an HTML page. The server returns an HTML file.
// The browser requests a style sheet. The server returns a CSS file.
// The browser requests an JPG image. The server returns a JPG file.
// The browser requests JavaScript code. The server returns a JS file
// The browser requests data. The server returns data (in XML or JSON).
